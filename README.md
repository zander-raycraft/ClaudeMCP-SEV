# ðŸš€Optimize Claude with Custom Model Control Plugins (MCPs)

Welcome to the **Custom MCPs** repository, for enhancing Claude with modular, developer-friendly Model Control Plugins (MCPs). These plugins are designed to be highly customizable, enabling you to tailor Claudeâ€™s functionality to your specific needs with ease.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to integrate Custom MCPs with Claude and unlock their full potential.

### Prerequisites

- **Claude Developer Mode**: Ensure developer mode is enabled in Claude to utilize MCP functionality.
- **Node.js**: Install Node.js (version 16 or higher) to manage dependencies.
- **npm**: Included with Node.js for package management.

### Installation Steps

1. **Navigate to an MCP Directory**  
   Access the folder of the desired MCP:

   ```bash
   cd path/to/your/mcp-folder
   ```

   *Example*: `cd txt-logger`

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Run the following command to install all required dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Build the MCP**  
   Compile the MCP to generate the `dist/index.js` file:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Configure Claude**  
   Update your `claude_desktop_config.json` file by adding the following entry under `mcpServers`:

   ```json
   {
       "mcpServers": {
           "<mcp-tool-name>": {
               "command": "node",
               "args": ["path/to/dist/index.js"]
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   - `<mcp-tool-name>`: Specify a unique name for your MCP (e.g., `txt-logger`).  
   - `path/to/dist/index.js`: Provide the path to the `dist/index.js` file generated during the build process.

### Example Configuration

For the `txt-logger` MCP, your `claude_desktop_config.json` might look like this:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "txt-logger": {
            "command": "node",
            "args": ["./txt-logger/dist/index.js"]
        }
    }
}
```
